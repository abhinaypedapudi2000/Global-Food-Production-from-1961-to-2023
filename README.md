Global Food Production Trends Analysis (1961–2023)

📝 Project Overview
Conducted by ABC Company, this project is a comprehensive data analysis of global agricultural trends over a 62-year period. Using Power BI, the study transforms raw agricultural data into actionable insights, focusing on staple grains, commercial crops like coffee and tea, and major fruit categories.

The analysis provides a strategic roadmap for understanding food security, regional production dominance, and historical growth patterns in the agricultural sector.

🚀 Key Insights & Scenarios
🌾 Staple Grain Dominance

The study identifies a massive scale of production for core global staples:

Wheat: 203 Billion Tonnes (Highest growth trajectory).

Rice: 206 Billion Tonnes.

Maize: Shown consistent growth, particularly accelerating from the late 1980s.

☕ Commercial & Beverage Crops

Tea: Totaled 1 billion tonnes globally.

Coffee (Green): Africa identified as a leading producer, followed closely by Asia and the Americas.

🍎 Fruit Production Leaders

Grapes lead the fruit category in total volume, followed by apples and bananas. | Fruit | Total Production (1961-2023) | | :--- | :--- | | Grapes | 30 Billion Tonnes | | Apples | 25 Billion Tonnes | | Bananas | 23 Billion Tonnes | | Oranges | 21 Billion Tonnes |

📊 Visualizations (Scenarios)
The Power BI dashboard is organized into eight specific analytical scenarios:

Rice & Wheat Totals: High-level KPI cards showing cumulative global volume.

Tea Production Gauge: A visual representation of tea output relative to global targets/scales.

Regional Coffee Distribution: Bar charts highlighting the production power of Africa and the Americas.

Grain Growth Trends: An Area Chart tracking the year-over-year rise of Wheat, Maize, and Rice.

Fruit Diversification: Stacked bar charts showing regional contributions to the production of Avocados, Bananas, and Apples.

Maize Evolution: A Donut Chart illustrating the distribution of maize production across specific historical eras.

Fruit Comparison: Comparative bar charts ranking global fruit popularity by weight.

🛠️ Tools Used
Power BI Desktop: For data modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive visualization.

Data Source: Historical agricultural records (1961–2023).

Data Transformation: Power Query for cleaning regional entities and normalizing production tonnes.

📈 Strategic Value
This project enables ABC Company to:

Identify emerging markets based on regional production growth.

Understand supply chain stability by analyzing the historical consistency of staple crops.

Support investment decisions in the agricultural sector by identifying high-volume commodities like grapes and wheat.
